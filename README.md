# Phishing-websites-detection
phishing websites detection using Deep Neural Networks

The DNN model used for this experiment in detecting phishing websites uses Keras and Tensorflow libraries. It has three layers (the input layer has 256 neurons with Sigmoid as an activation function, the hidden layer with 10 neurons with ReLU as an activation function, and the output layer from 1 neuron and Softmax as an activation function). Also, the model use Adam as an optimizer and ‘binary_crossentropy’ as a loss function.
